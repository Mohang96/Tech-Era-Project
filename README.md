The project aims to get hands-on experience with Fetching and Routing in Reactjs.
In this, we will create Home, CourseItemDetails, CourseItem, Header, and NotFound components.
While Fetching, We will be handling different states of response objects and displaying corresponding components, respectively.

In the Home route, we will display an array of courses and upon clicking it will be routed to the respective courseItemDetails route.
In the CourseDetails route, we will display course details.
When none of the routes matches the given URL, then we will be displaying the NotFound route.

Se-Up Instructions:
